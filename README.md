The Pump.fun smart contract is a decentralized system that manages the creation, distribution, and trading of tokens using a bonding curve model.

A bonding curve is a mathematical model that determines a token's price based on its supply. In the Pump.fun smart contract, this bonding curve allows for dynamic pricing:

When tokens are purchased: The contract mints new tokens, increasing the supply and driving the price up along the bonding curve.
When tokens are sold: The contract burns tokens, decreasing the supply and lowering the price on the curve.
This ensures a predictable and transparent price change mechanism, which benefits early buyers and creates a self-balancing market.
